    <p>
      I started this website in my first couple weeks in Dev Bootcamp. It looked like something out of the mid 1990's. It was just a framework of HTML, there was no styling or flow to it, just some raw text. Since then it has come a long way, I've used CSS to add some color and positioning to it. It now looks like a real website and blog, albiet still one in it's infancy. There is still a lot more I can do to this to make it a site someone would want to visit, but I am well on my way there. It has certainly been a nice way to keep some kind of lasting record of my journey through these first steps into the coding world.
