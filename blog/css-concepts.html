    <h2>Margin, Borders, and Padding</h2>
  <body>
    <p>
        The margin, border, and padding are aspects of each HTML element. That is, they define the spacing around each and every part of a webpage. They are used in conjunction with positioning to keep a site from getting cluttered, as well as ensuring it has a good flow to it. Without these aspects, everything on the page would be butting up against one another.

        First, here is an image that graphically represents the relationship between these 3 aspects and the original content:</br>

        <img src="http://www.w3schools.com/css/box-model.gif"></br>

        So as you can see, from the inside out, you have the original content, the padding, the border, and the margin. The padding is simply the space between the content and the border. The border is the space seperating the padding and the margin. Last, the margin is the space between the element and any other elements around it. It is how you keep everything seperated.

        So, as an example, take the search box on the Google homepage. You have the content- what you are typing in the search box. then you have the padding- the space between the text you are typing and the edge of the search box. The edge of the search box is the border. Lastly, you have the margin, the space that is seperating the search box from anything else on the webpage.
