        I had a lot of trouble translating a wireframe into HTML, possibly because I had so much trouble wireframing. I was unable to do some of the things I had originally planned for the webpages, so I found alternatives to them. Once I feel I have a better grounding in HTML I will come back and implement changes that I had originally wanted to make. I specifically had trouble because things I'd done creating the Berkshire HTML page didn't work the same way for me when creating my own webpages. But there's nothing to do but press on and keep learning.

        I learned quite a few new elements to HTML, mostly things associated with linking images and other webpages to an existing page. It was nice to be able to have an idea in your head of how you wanted something to look and work and then be able to put that into something you could see and interact with. I liked being able to create links with clickable pictures especially.

        I'm excited to be able to make this website look like something more than some text and links. I have a picture up but I'd like to be able to make it look more polished and welcoming. Right now it works, but that's about the only praise you could give it. I want this to be something I can be proud of.
