  <h1>Using Git and Github</h1>
  <h2>Version control and its importance</h2>
  <h4>October 3rd, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Version control provides many benefits for a user. It keeps your work saved at many different points to allow you to look back at changes you've made previously and see how they've affected your code. If mistakes were made it allows you to go back to a previous version and see where you went wrong, and when working on code that has gone live it allows you to keep working code running while you make changes. It also will keep you from losing massive amounts of work if your machine crashes, since you will be saving your work constantly. There is really nothing more frustrating than losing work and having to redo it all.

      Git helps you keep track of changes with your commit messages. Everytime you save your work you can add a commit message in which you can explain exactly what changed in this version and why you made the change, as well as any other information you think would be applicable. Git will also keep a log telling you who made the change if there are multiple people on the project and when the change was made.
    </p>
    <p>
        Github is the ideal way to store your code because it has a very clean and relatively easy to use interface, as well as not requiring much processing power from your machine. It is great because it will allow you to access your work from any device, anywhere. It is also nice that it allows multiple people to work on the same code without them tripping over each other. All in all, there are other services like Github, but Github seems to have the best combination of simplicity, reliability, and ease of use.
