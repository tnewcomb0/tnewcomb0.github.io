What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that I still have a lot of learning still to go. I thought that things would cometogether a little quicker and easier than they did. I spent most of my time troubleshooting one thing or another.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that positioning is also a very difficult aspect of CSS. I still don't feel I have a great grasp on how it all works together. I'm looking forward to the GPS next week so I can get some hands-on time with someone who knows what they're doing. I learned that for now, if I'm stuck, absolute positioning seems to work the most consistantly, but it isn't something I would want to rely on.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I found that making it pretty was the easiest thing. Changing how it looked (color, font size and font style) was quite simple and fun. However, positioning was a whole different story. I spent about 3.5 of the 4 hours on the challenge working on that.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned a lot with the help of the DOM. It was nice to be able to play with the CSS live and immediately see what changeing something did. But like I said before, I mostly learned how much more I still have to learn.
