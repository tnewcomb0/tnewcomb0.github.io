<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was nice to have someone to bounce ideas off of. I also found it helpful to be able to check out another wireframing interface. The HTML part was pretty much a breeze after doing the Berkshire website, as you could use that if you ever got stuck working on this portion.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I still feel similarly about wireframing as I did during the solo exercise, it seemed like you spent a lot of time using software that just didn't seem to work very well to create something very simple that didn't seem to help very much. But that could just be because I am still using simple tools and I don't really know what I'm doing yet.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided you should use a wireframe to just get the skeleton of the webpage down. You wanted navigation to be intuitive and easy to use, and that you didn't ever want to have to search around the page to find the thing you were looking for. The thing that we agreed is most aggravating is poorly designed navigation bars.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

I can't say I really learned any new ones, as this assignment was a bit simpler than the solo wireframing challenge and the 2.6 paired HTML challenge.
